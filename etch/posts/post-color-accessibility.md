Color contrast isn't just about aesthetics — it's essential for readability, accessibility, and inclusion. According to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), body text should meet a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1.

To experiment with this, I built a small browser tool that lets designers test combinations of background and text colors, using live rendering and WCAG scoring:

```js
function contrastRatio(hex1, hex2) {
  const L1 = luminance(hex1);
  const L2 = luminance(hex2);
  return (Math.max(L1, L2) + 0.05) / (Math.min(L1, L2) + 0.05);
}
```

The app provides instant feedback, flagging color pairs that fail accessibility guidelines. You can view a live version here: [Accessible Palettes](https://accessible-palette.example.com)

As a bonus, I added features for exporting CSS variables and previewing your palette on sample UIs. It’s a lightweight way to bridge the gap between creativity and compliance.

If you’re designing for the web, mobile, or even print — it's worth incorporating accessibility into your workflow from the beginning. Small choices in color can have a big impact on usability.
