**Retina** is a deep learning project trained to identify diabetic retinopathy from retinal scans. The model was built as a weekend challenge and later extended into a mini-service with an API, preprocessing pipeline, and demo UI.

The dataset came from a public Kaggle competition, and performance was validated against held-out folds and third-party graders. Itâ€™s not FDA-cleared (obviously), but it performs surprisingly well for a side project.

### Highlights

- **CNN architecture**: Custom ResNet variant fine-tuned on retinal imagery
- **Preprocessing pipeline**: OpenCV used for image alignment, denoising, and normalization
- **Web API**: FastAPI wrapper for easy inference and integration
- **Dashboard demo**: Interactive UI for exploring predictions and heatmaps
- **Built for learning**: Annotated notebooks and modular code structure
