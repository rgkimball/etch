**Pattern** is a modular design system aimed at fast prototyping and presentation-ready visuals. It originated as a personal experiment to streamline pitch deck creation, portfolio mockups, and lightweight UI kits â€” all without touching a line of JavaScript.

The project focuses on clarity, contrast, and convention. Each template and component is deliberately constrained to encourage harmony across use cases, and the system works equally well in Figma or exported to static HTML.

### Highlights

- **Component-driven**: Build layouts with reusable blocks
- **Web-native**: All outputs export cleanly to static HTML and CSS
- **Design-first**: Prioritizes typography, spacing, and contrast
- **Lightweight**: No dependencies or JS required
- **AI-enhanced**: Used GPT-4 to generate starter wireframes from briefs
